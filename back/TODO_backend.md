- [ ] BoardUpdate: broadcast
- [ ] LineDestroyed: broadcast board + envoyer les lignes malus a une victime random
- [ ] GameOver: broadcast gameover + send leaderboard position
- [ ] Keep leaderboard total size + current size
- [ ] Deal with user leaving page (no update in 30sec) = dead
- [ ] Follow-up: Producer consumer? Then we can't fully verify moves (task from same client/player needs to be tackled by same consumer, or order needs to be introduced -> sucks).
- [ ] Follow-up: create rooms! Multiple game rooms at the same time
    - [ ] Send new messages to tell how many people were found/are currently waiting
- [ ] Follow-up (no, please): verify game board updates are good
